  * [within_voronoi_transation](https://github.com/yvesalexandre/privacy-tools/blob/master/within_voronoi_translation.py): Noise is often added to the GPS coordinates of antennas to hinter's an attacker ability to link outside information to the released database. This code takes as input a list of antennas location and moves them uniformly within their voronoi cell. The noise added is proportional to the density of antennas in the region while preserving the overall structure of the mesh.
